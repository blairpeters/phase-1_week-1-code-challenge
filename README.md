consists of the following challenges:

Challenge 1: Student Grade Generator (Toy Problem) under (studentgrade.js file)

consists of a function that prompts the user to input student marks. The input hasto  be between 0 and 100. The output should correspond the correct grade, as shown below: 

        A > 79, B - 60 to 79, C -  59 to 49, D - 40 to 49, E - less 40.

        if output is not between 0 and 100 it returns  "Invalid input. Please enter a valid marks between 0 and 100."

 
Challenge 2: Speed Detector (Toy Problem) under (speeddetector.js file)

Write a program that takes the speed of a car as input e.g 80. If the speed is less than 70, it should print “Ok”. Otherwise, for every 5 km/s above the speed limit (70), it should give the driver one demerit point and print the total number of demerit points.

   > For example, if the speed is 80, it should print: “Points: 2”. If the driver gets more than 12 points, the function should print: “License suspended”.
